# DeadLanguage

DeadLanguage or LinguaMortua is a collection of less-mainstream Latin resources for reading and study. The idea arose from a desire to have reading material with me, beyond the Latin Bible.

I considered adding English translations, but most are copyrighted and I didn't want to have a mixture of translated and untranslated text.

Most of the included Latin sources are from the Medieval time period or earlier and all are freely available under public domain. The app itself falls under the MIT License.
