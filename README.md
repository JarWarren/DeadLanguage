# DeadLanguage

DeadLanguage or LinguaMortua is a collection of less-mainstream Latin resources for reading and study. The idea arose from a desire to have reading material with me, beyond the Latin Bible.

I considered adding English translations, but most are copyrighted and I didn't want to have a mixture of translated and untranslated text.

All included Latin sources are from the Medieval time period and are therefore freely available under public domain.
